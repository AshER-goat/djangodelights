[App: "inventory" (soon to be a ligit link)](https://github.com/AshER-goat/djangodelights/sample)

This is an app created with Python and Django. It lets you add, delete, and update ingredients, menu items, and purchases of said menu items for a fake cafe. I've been doing digital art and front-end(some back-end) web design for years but I only just learned Python and Django. I hope this app does not disappoint!
 
Currently this cafe serves shakes with simple, wholesome ingredients coming in 4 flavors: Vanilla, Chocolate Malt, Strawberry, and Ultra Mega (all 3 flavors).
	
Per codecademy, this app should answer the following:
 
  What is currently in the restaurant’s inventory?
	What purchases have been made?
  What does the restaurant’s menu look like? What ingredients (and how many of each) are required for each item on the menu? 
	What’s the price of each item?
  What is the total revenue for the restaurant’s overall recorded purchases?
	What is the total cost to the restaurant’s overall purchases made (sum of cost of all ingredients used).
	How much profit (revenue - cost) does the restaurant make?
